Former auditor turned Data Scientist with a strong background in Big Data analytics, now with hands-on experience in data collection, transformation, and automation. Skilled in Python and its libraries, with expertise in machine learning, data extraction, feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and data visualization. I have successfully applied these skills during a 6-month internship, where I developed automated data pipelines and contributed to building cloud infrastructure. Ready to leverage my analytical and technical skills in a dynamic, innovative environment. Now looking for the next big endeavour.

## Projects

### I. Recommender Systems | Msc BigData 
**May 2024 (4 weeks)**
*Developed a recipe recommendation system using a dataset of user-recipe reviews with ratings and comments*

Implemented three recommendation approaches:
- Content-Based Filtering using recipe features (ingredients, prep time, description length, tags).
- Collaborative Filtering (user-based and item-based KNN with cosine and Pearson similarity).
- Matrix Factorization Models including ALS, SVD, and CoClustering.
- Conducted feature engineering for content-based modeling: processed text, ingredients, tags, prep times, and nutritional information.
- Performed train-test split based on review dates to simulate real-world recommendation scenarios.
- Evaluated models using RMSE and top-N recommendation metrics, achieving the best performance with the ALS model (RMSE ≈ 1.075).
- Generated top-N personalized recommendations for users and integrated predictions into submission-ready outputs.
- Documented the full model development, evaluation, and feature engineering process in Python notebooks, with Markdown explanations and visualizations.


### II. DeepLearning | Msc BigData 
**March 2024 (2 weeks)**

1. **Predicting Accident Severity with Image Data**
    - Trained three distinct Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) networks.
    - Explored Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) through experiments to find optimal settings.

2. **Sequence Prediction with RNNs**
    - Explored the application of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for a sequence prediction task.
- **Project Link:** [DeepLearning](https://github.com/K10Bops/DeepLearning)

### III. Big Data Tools | Msc BigData 
**Feburary 2024 (1 month)**

- Built a scalable PySpark pipeline on Databricks over 6 tables (~50k orders) to predict review polarity;
- Engineered delivery, payment, and item features; performed data cleaning and type casting;
- Trained cross-validated Logistic Regression and Gradient Boosted Tree classifiers with MLflow tracking;
- Conducted hyperparameter grid-search over maxIter and regParam (optimal: maxIter=10, regParam=0.01), achieving 81.55 % test accuracy and 0.82 AUC on a holdout dataset; pruned non-significant features; generated per-order_id predictions to drive delivery communications and post-purchase personalization strategies

### IV. Food Safety Inspection Classification (Class Competition – 5th/12) | Msc BigData 
**March 2024 (1 month)**

- Processed and analyzed 40k+ sanitary inspection records from the French open-data portal (Alim’confiance dataset, data.gouv.fr);
- Cleaned and standardized textual anomalies (e.g., encoding issues “TrÃ¨s satisfaisant” → “Très satisfaisant”); dropped irrelevant high-cardinality fields;
- Engineered temporal features (year, month, day), geographical groupings (postal code → department-level stats), and imputed missing values with category “Missing”;
- Built visualizations (correlation heatmaps, count plots) to understand relations between establishment type, geography, and hygiene outcomes;
- Trained and tuned a Random Forest classifier with GridSearchCV, achieving competitive accuracy and ranking 5th of 12 groups in class Kaggle-style competition;
